This game can be played by opening index.html in a web browser.  To play, use the up, left, right, and down arrow keys on the keyboard to make the player (at the bottom) move in the desired direction.  The goal is to get the player to the water without hitting a bug. Every time the player gets to the water, one point is scored.  However, if you hit a bug, the counter is reset!
